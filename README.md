* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen is shown congratulating you. After a few seconds the next question will appear -- without user input.
* The scenario is similiar for wrong answers and time-outs.
    * If the player runs out of time, the player will be told time is up and the correct answer will be revealed. After a few seconds the next question will be displayed.
    * If the player selects the wrong answer, the player will be told they have selected the wrong option and then the correct answer is revealed. After a few seconds the next quest will be displayed.
* When the game ends, the number of correct answers, wrong answers, and an option to start a new game (without page reload) is displayed.
